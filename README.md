Hello, I am Zhihao Wang, who recently joined [Duolingo](https://careers.duolingo.com) as a Senior Software Engineer after completing my Master's Degree in Software Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. 

Before CMU, I had gained a track record of delivering end-to-end products and services for 4+ years, as well as 2+ years of project management expertise as a Scrum Master. 

My previous experience primarily focused on designing and developing customer-facing products and services, but I have now shifted my focus to creating and managing infrastructures that aid engineers in their work. 

My areas of interest include microservices, distributed systems, cloud computing, database systems, developer productivity, and automation, among others.
