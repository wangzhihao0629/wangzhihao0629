Hello, I am Zhihao Wang. I joined [Duolingo](https://careers.duolingo.com) as a Senior Software Engineer after completing my Master's Degree in Software Engineering at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu).

Before CMU, I had gained a track record of delivering end-to-end products and services over four years as a Software Engineer, supplemented with two years of project management expertise as a Scrum Master. My previous experience primarily concerned designing and developing customer-facing products and services. I have now pivoted to managing cloud infrastructures that empower engineers.

My areas of interest include microservices, distributed systems, database systems, cloud infrastructures, developer productivity, among others.
